# Customer Personality Analysis
>Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.



The most important part of a customer personality analysis is getting the answers to questions such as:
What people say about your product: what gives customers’ attitude towards the product.
What people do: which reveals what people are doing rather than what they are saying about your product.
In the section below, I’ll walk you through a data science project on analyzing customer personality with python. Here I will be using a dataset that contains data collected from a marketing campaign, where our task is to predict how different customer segments will respond for a particular product or service.
